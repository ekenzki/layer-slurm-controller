      to augment the default FIFO scheduling. Backfill scheduling will initiate
      lower-priority jobs if doing so does not delay the expected initiation
      time of any higher priority job. Effectiveness of backfill scheduling is
      dependent upon users specifying job time limits, otherwise all jobs will
      have the same time limit and backfilling is impossible. Note documentation
      for the SchedulerParameters option above. This is the default
      configuration. sched/builtin This is the FIFO scheduler which initiates
      jobs in priority order. If any job in the partition can not be scheduled,
      no lower priority job in that partition will be scheduled. An exception is
      made for jobs that can not run due to partition constraints (e.g. the time
      limit) or down/drained nodes. In that case, lower priority jobs can be
      initiated and not impact the higher priority job. sched/hold To hold all
